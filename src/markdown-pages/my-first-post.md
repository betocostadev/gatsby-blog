### My first post here.

It's the first time I write something here. Today I just completed the course
 <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-react-developer-zero-to-mastery/" title="Course Homepage" target="_blank">
  Complete React Developer in 2020 (w/ Redux, Hooks, GraphQL)
</a>, taught by
 <a href="https://www.udemy.com/user/yihua-zhang-5/" title="Yihua Zhang's Udemy Page" target="_blank">
  Yihua Zhang
</a> and
 <a href="https://www.udemy.com/user/andrei-neagoie/" title="Andrei Neagoie's Udemy Page" target="_blank">
  Andrei Neagoie
</a>
  on
<a href="https://www.udemy.com/" title="Udemy's Homepage" target="_blank">Udemy</a>.

The course is great and as the title suggests, there is so much to learn. It really covers a lot of React with Redux, Hooks, GraphQL, and it also has a small section about <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/" target="_blank">Gatsby</a>. That's why I'm writing this post, because I did the last part of the course on Gatsby.

### My Objectives

Since there was so much content to learn, now it's time to practice React with Redux, with Hooks and create something using MongoDB with REST and then, create something with GraphQL.
